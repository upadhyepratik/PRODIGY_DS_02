Key Features Implemented in the Task:

The task involved performing data cleaning üßπ and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The key features implemented include:

1.Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data entries.
2.Data Exploration: I conducted an in-depth exploration üîç of the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and identify outliers.

About the Task:

The goal of this task was to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data. The analysis focused on understanding the factors that influenced the survival rates of the passengers on the Titanic.

Findings:

In conclusion, the data indicates that gender and passenger class had a significant impact on survival rates, with women and first-class passengers exhibiting higher survival rates. Age was also a crucial factor, as children and older adults were found to have a higher likelihood of survival. Furthermore, the correlation matrix points towards intricate interrelationships between these variables, providing valuable insights for further analysis.
